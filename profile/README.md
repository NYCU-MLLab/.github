### Machine Learning Lab National Yang Ming Chiao Tung Universityü§ñü§ñ

Hello everyone, we are Machine Learning Lab (MLLab) from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung Unviersity (NYCU) Taiwan under the supervision of Professor Jen-Tzung Chien (Á∞°‰ªÅÂÆó). Our main research area is Natural Language Processing, but we are also working on other field such as Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. 

<!-- #### Published Works
1. Aggregate a posteriori linear regression for speech recognition
2. Attribute decomposition for flow-based domain mapping
3. Causal confusion reduction for robust multi-domain dialogue policy
4. Collaborative Regularization for Bidirectional Domain Mapping -->
#### Current Project
1. Data Representation and Learning for Dialogue System
2. Data Efficiency for Deep Reinforcement Learning
3. Deep Latent Disentanglement for Domain Mapping and Learning

#### Past Project
1. Deep Learning for Speech and Language Processing
2. Bayesian Nonparametric Learning for Speech Recognition and Information Retrieval
3. Sparse Machine Learning for Audio, Speech and Language Processing
4. Machine Learning Methods for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition
5. ICA-Based Machine Learning Methods for Speech Separation
