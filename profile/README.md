### Machine Learning Lab National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University🤖🤖

Hello everyone, we are Machine Learning Lab (MLLab) from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung Unviersity (NYCU) Taiwan under the supervision of Professor Jen-Tzung Chien (簡仁宗). Our main research area is Natural Language Processing, but we are also working on other field such as Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. 

#### Published Works
1. Aggregate a posteriori linear regression for speech recognition
2. Attribute decomposition for flow-based domain mapping
3. Causal confusion reduction for robust multi-domain dialogue policy
4. Collaborative Regularization for Bidirectional Domain Mapping


#### Current Project
1. Data Representation and Learning for Dialogue System
2. Data Efficiency for Deep Reinforcement Learning
3. Deep Latent Disentanglement for Domain Mapping and Learning
